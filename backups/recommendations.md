# DigitalOcean Cleanup Recommendations

## Current Status After Phase 4 Cleanup

### Remaining Resources:
1. **app-oint-marketing** - $5/month (active, receiving traffic)
2. **app-oint-business** - $5/month (active, custom domain)
3. **app-oint-web-platform** - $5/month (active, main platform)
4. **app-oint-enterprise** - $5/month (active, custom domain)
5. **appoint-app-v2** - $20/month (Frankfurt, 4 services, legacy)

### Resources Removed:
- ✅ **app-oint-web-platform-api-only** - $5/month (duplicate, no deployment)
- ✅ **ubuntu-s-2vcpu-4gb-120gb-intel-fra1-01** - $24/month (unused droplet)

## Optional Cost Cuts

### 1. appoint-app-v2 (High Priority - $20/month savings)
**Analysis**: This appears to be a legacy version with 4 services in Frankfurt region. The main platform is now in NYC.

**Commands to delete**:
```bash
doctl apps delete 76999f0d-0491-48a6-841e-233a61ef2d37 --force
```

**Risk**: Low - appears to be legacy version
**Savings**: $20/month

### 2. app-oint-marketing (Medium Priority - $5/month savings)
**Analysis**: This standalone marketing app may be duplicated in other apps. Verify if needed.

**Commands to delete**:
```bash
doctl apps delete 8e32af1d-3311-4706-add5-63284ee2e514 --force
```

**Risk**: Medium - verify it's not needed before deletion
**Savings**: $5/month

## Total Potential Savings
- **Immediate**: $29/month (completed)
- **Optional**: $25/month (if removing v2 app and standalone marketing)
- **Total**: $54/month potential savings

## Current Monthly Cost Estimate
- **Remaining Apps**: $40/month (5 apps × $8 average)
- **Domain**: $1/month
- **Total**: ~$41/month (down from ~$70/month)

## Backup Information
- All app specs backed up to: `./backups/do-apps/`
- DNS records backed up to: `./backups/dns-app-oint.com.txt`
- Snapshot attempt made for droplet (may have failed)

## Recommendations
1. **Immediate**: Keep current setup as is - all remaining apps are active
2. **Optional**: Consider removing appoint-app-v2 if confirmed legacy
3. **Future**: Monitor usage patterns to identify further optimization opportunities
