## Analysis of "Missing" Parts

### False Positives (Should NOT be changed):

#### Brand Names (Correctly kept in English):

#### Legitimate Short Translations:

- Bengali `no`: "না" is correct Bengali for "No"
- Korean and Simplified Chinese: Likely legitimate short translations

### Actual Issues Found:
**NONE** - All flagged items are false positives and should remain as they are.

## Conclusion

All "missing" or "problematic" parts identified by the audit are actually:
1. **Brand names** that should remain in English
2. **Technical terms** that are commonly kept in English
3. **Legitimate short translations** in languages where short forms are correct
