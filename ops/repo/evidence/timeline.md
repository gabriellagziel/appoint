# Repository Timeline Analysis

## Appoint (Main Monorepo) vs Appoint-Web-Only

### Key Findings

#### Repository Origins
- **Appoint (Main)**: Monorepo containing Flutter app + multiple Next.js web apps
- **Appoint-Web-Only**: Created on 2025-08-07 as "Initial web-only code"

#### Critical Timeline Events

**2025-08-07**: `appoint-web-only` repository created
- First commit: "Initial web-only code"
- Immediately followed by cleanup commits removing problematic files
- Focus shifted to minimal health check API only

**2025-08-06**: Main repo shows "web-only deployment" focus
- Commit: "chore: update do-app.yaml for web-only deployment"
- Commit: "ci: update CI/CD for web-only Next.js build matrix"

**2025-08-02**: Main repo major cleanup
- Commit: "ðŸŽ‰ Perfect Codebase: Cleaned up 159 duplicate node_modules, removed 26+ temp files"
- Commit: "ðŸ”§ Fix 153 Microsoft Edge browser compatibility issues"

#### Deployment Configuration Mismatch

**Current State**:
- Main repo `do-app.yaml` points to `gabriellagziel/appoint-web-only` repository
- Main repo has Vercel config for marketing app
- `appoint-web-only` has minimal Express health check API
- `appoint-web-only` README claims to have multiple apps that don't exist

#### Evidence of Split Purpose

1. **Main Repo**: Full monorepo with Flutter + Next.js apps
2. **Web-Only Repo**: Minimal health check API for DigitalOcean deployment
3. **Deployment**: Main repo configured to deploy from web-only repo
4. **Timing**: Split occurred during major cleanup/refactoring phase

### Hypothesis: Temporary Deployment Workaround

The `appoint-web-only` repository appears to have been created as a temporary solution during a major codebase cleanup, specifically to:
1. Provide a clean deployment target for DigitalOcean
2. Avoid complex monorepo build issues
3. Serve minimal health check endpoints

This suggests the split was **not intentional architecture** but rather a **deployment workaround** during refactoring.
