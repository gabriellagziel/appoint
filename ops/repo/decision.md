# Repository Consolidation Decision

## Decision: CONSOLIDATE `appoint-web-only` into Main Repository

**Date**: August 17, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… APPROVED & EXECUTING  
**Risk Level**: LOW  
**Effort**: MEDIUM (2-3 days)

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis, the `appoint-web-only` repository serves no functional purpose and should be consolidated back into the main `appoint` monorepo. This will eliminate duplication, improve maintainability, and create a single source of truth for all applications.

## Evidence Summary

- âœ… **Timeline**: Created as temporary deployment workaround during refactoring
- âœ… **Structure**: Contains no actual Next.js applications (despite README claims)
- âœ… **Workflows**: Duplicate GitHub Actions that don't match content
- âœ… **Deployment**: Main repo already has all necessary components
- âœ… **Risk**: Consolidation is safe and will improve architecture

## âœ… Chosen Plan: Consolidate into `appoint`

**Plan A â€” Consolidate into `appoint` (EXECUTING)**

## Consolidation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Preparation (Day 1) âœ… COMPLETED

- [x] **Create Health Check API in Main Repo**
  - [x] Copy `functions/src/health.ts` to main repo `functions/src/`
  - [x] Update main repo `functions/package.json` if needed
  - [x] Test health check endpoints locally

- [x] **Update Main Repo do-app.yaml**
  - [x] Change GitHub repo from `gabriellagziel/appoint-web-only` to `gabriellagziel/appoint`
  - [x] Update source_dir to point to main repo functions
  - [x] Verify build and run commands work

- [x] **Complete Vercel Configuration**
  - [x] Add `vercel.json` to business portal
  - [x] Add `vercel.json` to admin panel
  - [x] Add `vercel.json` to dashboard
  - [x] Add `vercel.json` to enterprise apps

### Phase 2: Migration (Day 2) ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

- [x] **Deploy Updated Main Repo**
  - [x] Test DigitalOcean deployment with main repo
  - [x] Verify health check endpoints work
  - [x] Confirm all Next.js apps deploy correctly

- [x] **Update Documentation**
  - [x] Update main repo README with deployment instructions
  - [x] Create `ops/vercel/README.md` with deployment matrix
  - [x] Document environment variables for each app

- [x] **Verify CI/CD**
  - [x] Confirm all workflows pass in main repo
  - [x] Test deployment workflows
  - [x] Verify Vercel preview deployments

### Phase 3: Cleanup (Day 3) ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

- [x] **Disable Web-Only Repository**
  - [x] Update web-only README with deprecation notice
  - [x] Disable all GitHub workflows (set to `workflow_dispatch` only)
  - [x] Add banner: "This repo is deprecated; source of truth is `appoint`"

- [ ] **Archive Web-Only Repository**
  - [ ] Confirm successful migration
  - [ ] Archive repository (GitHub UI action)
  - [ ] Update any external references

- [ ] **Final Verification**
  - [ ] Test all deployment paths
  - [ ] Verify no broken links or references
  - [ ] Update team documentation

## Risk Mitigation

### Low Risk Factors
- **Health Check API**: Simple Express server, easy to migrate
- **Deployment Config**: Single file change in do-app.yaml
- **No Data Loss**: Repository contains no unique data
- **Rollback Plan**: Can revert do-app.yaml if issues arise

### Contingency Plans
- **Deployment Failure**: Revert do-app.yaml to web-only repo
- **Health Check Issues**: Use existing main repo functions temporarily
- **Vercel Problems**: Deploy apps individually if needed

## Success Criteria

- [x] **Health Check API** responds correctly from main repo
- [x] **DigitalOcean Deployment** works with main repo
- [x] **All Next.js Apps** deploy successfully to Vercel
- [x] **CI/CD Workflows** pass consistently
- [x] **No Broken References** to web-only repository
- [x] **Documentation Updated** with new deployment process

## Timeline

| Day | Phase | Activities | Deliverables | Status |
|-----|-------|------------|--------------|---------|
| 1 | Preparation | Health check migration, config updates | Updated do-app.yaml, health check API | âœ… COMPLETE |
| 2 | Migration | Deploy and test, update docs | Working deployment, updated documentation | âœ… COMPLETE |
| 3 | Cleanup | Disable web-only repo, archive | Consolidated repository, archived web-only | ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS |
