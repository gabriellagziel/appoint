=== PERSONAL UI/UX DEEP AUDIT RESULTS ===
Timestamp: 2025-08-25_233355

## KEY FINDINGS:
✅ PERSONAL ROUTE CONFIGURATION FOUND in business/vercel.json
✅ MEETING FLOW COMMITS FOUND (Flutter-based)
❌ NO REACT/WEB PERSONAL UI COMPONENTS FOUND
❌ NO PERSONAL ROUTE PAGES FOUND

## PERSONAL ROUTE CONFIG:
business/vercel.json → personal.app-oint.com → /personal/$1

## MEETING FLOW COMMITS (Flutter):
- 78627917: scaffold modular type-aware create flow
- 2f9dd6e8: reminders + meeting route review
- fe7f9496: Review step and submit handler
- 83b6f5e4: Create Meeting and Set Reminder quick actions
- 13623e90: meeting details page parity

## PERSONAL SPEC DOCUMENTATION:
- 520fad84: personal user subdomain spec + code audit

## CONCLUSION:
Personal UI exists as Flutter mobile app, not as web React components.
Personal.app-oint.com is configured to route to /personal/ but no web pages exist.

Would need to either:
1) Build web React components from scratch
2) Convert Flutter web to React components
3) Use Flutter web build for personal.app-oint.com
