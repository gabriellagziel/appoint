# CI Stabilization Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the changes made during the CI/Vercel stabilization effort to silence failing CI spam, fix misconfigured GitHub Actions, and get Vercel previews green.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Broken Workflows

#### Web Deploy Workflow (`web-deploy.yml`)
- **Fixed**: Malformed YAML structure with incorrectly ordered `push:` and `on:` sections
- **Added**: Path scoping for web apps (marketing, business, admin, enterprise-onboarding-portal)
- **Added**: Permissions, concurrency controls, and timeouts
- **Enhanced**: Added proper Node.js setup and build steps for all web apps

#### Coverage Badge Workflow (`coverage-badge.yml`)
- **Fixed**: Malformed YAML structure
- **Added**: Path scoping for appoint and test directories
- **Added**: Permissions, concurrency controls, and timeouts
- **Enhanced**: Added Flutter setup and actual coverage generation

#### L10N Audit Workflow (`l10n_audit.yml`)
- **Added**: Path scoping for localization-related changes
- **Added**: Permissions, concurrency controls
- **Enhanced**: Maintained existing timeout and Flutter setup

### 2. Enhanced Core Workflows

#### Main CI Workflow (`ci.yml`)
- **Added**: Path scoping for relevant app directories
- **Added**: Permissions and concurrency controls
- **Added**: Timeouts for all jobs (5-20 minutes)
- **Enhanced**: Guarded secret-dependent steps on PRs (FIREBASE_TOKEN)
- **Fixed**: PR builds now skip deployment steps that require secrets

#### Security Workflow (`security.yml`)
- **Added**: Path scoping for security-relevant changes
- **Added**: Permissions and concurrency controls
- **Added**: Timeouts for all security jobs (10-15 minutes)
- **Enhanced**: Maintained all security scanning capabilities

#### Auto Merge Workflow (`auto-merge.yml`)
- **Fixed**: Malformed YAML structure
- **Added**: Path scoping for workflow changes
- **Added**: Permissions (including pull-requests: write)
- **Added**: Concurrency controls and timeouts
- **Enhanced**: Maintained auto-merge functionality

### 3. Added New Workflows

#### Actionlint Workflow (`actionlint.yml`)
- **Purpose**: GitHub Actions syntax and best practices validation
- **Features**: Path scoping for workflow changes, permissions, concurrency
- **Execution**: Installs and runs actionlint locally for validation

### 4. Documentation Created

#### CI Inventory (`ops/ci/_inventory.md`)
- **Content**: Comprehensive inventory of all 30+ workflows
- **Details**: Triggers, jobs, external actions, secrets requirements
- **Issues**: Identified common problems and recommended solutions

#### Required Checks (`ops/ci/_required_checks.md`)
- **Content**: List of checks required for branch protection
- **Details**: Workflow names, purposes, expected durations
- **Instructions**: GitHub branch protection setup guide

#### Vercel Documentation (`ops/vercel/README.md`)
- **Content**: Monorepo mapping for Vercel deployments
- **Details**: Root directories, build commands, environment variables
- **Setup**: Configuration instructions for each web app

#### Preview Environment (`ops/vercel/preview.env.example`)
- **Content**: Example environment variables for preview deployments
- **Coverage**: All web apps (marketing, business, admin, enterprise)
- **Security**: No actual secrets, only placeholders

#### Verification Script (`ops/ci/verify.sh`)
- **Purpose**: Automated CI workflow validation
- **Features**: YAML syntax check, configuration validation, GitHub CLI integration
- **Usage**: Run locally to verify workflow health

## Key Improvements

### 1. Noise Reduction
- **Path Scoping**: Workflows now only run when relevant files change
- **Concurrency Controls**: Prevents multiple workflows from running simultaneously
- **Timeouts**: Prevents infinite hangs and resource waste

### 2. PR Safety
- **Secret Guards**: Secret-dependent steps are skipped on PRs
- **Permissions**: Explicit permission declarations prevent access issues
- **Graceful Degradation**: PR builds succeed even without production secrets

### 3. Monorepo Optimization
- **App-Specific Triggers**: Web apps only build when their code changes
- **Shared Dependencies**: Common dependencies are managed efficiently
- **Vercel Integration**: Clear mapping for preview and production deployments

### 4. Maintainability
- **Standardized Structure**: All workflows follow consistent patterns
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for setup and troubleshooting
- **Validation**: Automated checks catch configuration issues early

## Files Modified

### Workflow Files
- `.github/workflows/watchdog.yml` - Already properly configured
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Enhanced with guards and scoping
- `.github/workflows/web-deploy.yml` - Fixed structure and enhanced
- `.github/workflows/security.yml` - Enhanced with scoping and controls
- `.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml` - Fixed structure and enhanced
- `.github/workflows/coverage-badge.yml` - Fixed structure and enhanced
- `.github/workflows/l10n_audit.yml` - Enhanced with scoping and controls
- `.github/workflows/actionlint.yml` - New workflow for validation

### Documentation Files
- `ops/ci/_inventory.md` - New comprehensive inventory
- `ops/ci/_required_checks.md` - New branch protection guide
- `ops/ci/STABILIZATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document
- `ops/ci/verify.sh` - New verification script
- `ops/vercel/README.md` - New Vercel configuration guide
- `ops/vercel/preview.env.example` - New environment variables example

## Next Steps

### 1. Immediate Actions
- [ ] Test the fixed workflows with a small change
- [ ] Verify that path scoping works correctly
- [ ] Check that PR builds succeed without secrets
- [ ] Validate that the watchdog passes quickly

### 2. GitHub Configuration
- [ ] Update branch protection rules with required checks
- [ ] Configure required status checks: CI Watchdog, actionlint, CI, Security
- [ ] Test branch protection with a PR

### 3. Vercel Setup
- [ ] Configure Vercel projects for each web app
- [ ] Set root directories according to the documentation
- [ ] Configure preview environment variables
- [ ] Test preview deployments

### 4. Monitoring
- [ ] Run the verification script regularly
- [ ] Monitor workflow execution times
- [ ] Track success rates and failure patterns
- [ ] Optimize slow workflows as needed

## Expected Outcomes

### Before Stabilization
- ❌ CI Watchdog failing in ~4 seconds
- ❌ Meta jobs failing (web-deploy, security, coverage, auto-merge)
- ❌ Vercel preview deployments failing
- ❌ Workflows running on unrelated changes
- ❌ PR builds failing due to missing secrets

### After Stabilization
- ✅ CI Watchdog passes quickly and reliably
- ✅ Meta jobs run only when relevant and succeed
- ✅ Vercel previews deploy correctly for changed apps
- ✅ Workflows are scoped to relevant changes only
- ✅ PR builds succeed gracefully without secrets
- ✅ Consistent workflow structure and behavior

## Compliance Notes

### Admin App English-Only
- **Maintained**: Admin app localization jobs remain untouched
- **Requirement**: Admin app must remain English-only as per project requirements
- **Implementation**: L10N audit workflow excludes admin-specific changes

### Security Considerations
- **Secrets**: No secrets are committed to the repository
- **Permissions**: Minimal required permissions for each workflow
- **Access**: Workflows only access what they need to function

## Support and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- **Monthly**: Review workflow performance and success rates
- **Quarterly**: Update required checks based on new critical workflows
- **As Needed**: Optimize slow workflows and add new validations

### Troubleshooting
- **Use**: `ops/ci/verify.sh` script for workflow health checks
- **Check**: GitHub Actions tab for workflow run status
- **Monitor**: Workflow execution times and resource usage
- **Document**: Any issues and resolutions for future reference
