## 🔧 Technical Implementation Highlights

### **Firebase Mocking Framework**

```dart
// Comprehensive mocking for all Firebase services
@GenerateMocks([
  FirebaseAuth, User, UserCredential,
  FirebaseFirestore, CollectionReference,
  DocumentReference, DocumentSnapshot,
  QuerySnapshot, Query, FirebaseStorage,
  Reference, UploadTask, TaskSnapshot,
])
```

### **Quality Gates Implementation**

```yaml
# Automated quality evaluation
quality-gates:
  code-coverage:
    threshold: 80
    fail-if-below: true
  performance:
    frame-time-threshold: 16ms
    startup-time-threshold: 2s
  security:
    critical-vulnerabilities: 0
    high-vulnerabilities: 0
```

### **Test Data Factory**

```dart
// Reusable test data for consistent testing
class TestDataFactory {
  static Map<String, dynamic> createUserData({...})
  static Map<String, dynamic> createAppointmentData({...})
  static Map<String, dynamic> createProviderData({...})
  static Map<String, dynamic> createBroadcastMessageData({...})
}
```
