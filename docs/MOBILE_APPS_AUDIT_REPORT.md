# Mobile Apps Audit Report

## iOS and Android Security & Configuration Audit

**Date:** August 2, 2024  
**Auditor:** AI Assistant  
**Scope:** iOS and Android mobile applications for Appoint platform

---

## Executive Summary

This audit covers both iOS and Android mobile applications for the Appoint platform. The audit reveals several security concerns, configuration issues, and areas for improvement across both platforms.

### Overall Risk Assessment: **MEDIUM-HIGH**

---

## Android App Audit

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues

#### 1. **Java Version Compatibility**

- **Issue:** Android Gradle plugin requires Java 17, but system is using Java 11
- **Impact:** Build failures, potential compatibility issues
- **Recommendation:** Upgrade to Java 17 or configure project to use Java 17

#### 2. **Cleartext Traffic Allowed**

- **Issue:** `android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"` in AndroidManifest.xml
- **Location:** `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:42`
- **Impact:** Allows insecure HTTP connections, potential data interception
- **Recommendation:** Remove this setting and ensure all connections use HTTPS

#### 3. **Exposed API Keys**

- **Issue:** Google Maps and Firebase API keys exposed in configuration files
- **Location:** `android/app/google-services.json`
- **Impact:** Potential API abuse, quota exhaustion
- **Recommendation:** Use environment variables or secure key management

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority Issues

#### 4. **Excessive Permissions**

The app requests many permissions that may not all be necessary:

**High-Risk Permissions:**

- `READ_PHONE_STATE` - Could be used for device fingerprinting
- `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` - Broad file access
- `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` - File system write access
- `READ_CALENDAR` / `WRITE_CALENDAR` - Calendar access

**Recommendation:** Review each permission and implement runtime permission requests with proper justification.

#### 5. **Signing Configuration**

- **Issue:** Hardcoded keystore path and default passwords
- **Location:** `android/app/build.gradle.kts:22-26`
- **Recommendation:** Use environment variables for all signing configuration

### ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority Issues

#### 6. **Build Configuration**

- **Issue:** ProGuard minification enabled but no custom rules visible
- **Recommendation:** Review and customize ProGuard rules for better code obfuscation

---

## iOS App Audit

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues

#### 1. **Arbitrary Loads Allowed**

- **Issue:** `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads` set to true in Info.plist
- **Location:** `ios/Runner/Info.plist:95`
- **Impact:** Allows insecure HTTP connections
- **Recommendation:** Remove this setting and use HTTPS for all connections

#### 2. **Exposed API Keys**

- **Issue:** Firebase configuration keys exposed in plist file
- **Location:** `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
- **Impact:** Potential API abuse
- **Recommendation:** Use secure key management or environment variables

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority Issues

#### 3. **Privacy Permissions**

All required usage descriptions are present, but some may be overly broad:

**Permissions with Usage Descriptions:**

- Camera access âœ…
- Photo library access âœ…
- Location access âœ…
- Calendar access âœ…
- Contacts access âœ…
- Microphone access âœ…
- Face ID access âœ…

**Recommendation:** Review if all permissions are actually needed and implement proper runtime permission handling.

#### 4. **URL Schemes**

- **Issue:** Custom URL scheme "appoint" registered
- **Location:** `ios/Runner/Info.plist:75-85`
- **Recommendation:** Ensure proper URL scheme validation to prevent deep link attacks

### ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority Issues

#### 5. **Background Modes**

- **Issue:** Background fetch and remote notifications enabled
- **Recommendation:** Ensure these features are properly implemented and don't drain battery

---

## Flutter Code Audit

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues

#### 1. **Insecure HTTP Usage**

- **Issue:** HTTP URL found in environment configuration
- **Location:** `lib/config/environment_config.dart`
- **Impact:** Potential data interception
- **Recommendation:** Use HTTPS for all production URLs

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority Issues

#### 2. **String Processing**

- **Issue:** URL manipulation without proper validation
- **Location:** `lib/widgets/business_header_widget.dart`
- **Recommendation:** Implement proper URL validation and sanitization

## Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Upgrade Java Version**

   ```bash
   # Install Java 17 and update JAVA_HOME
   export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java17
   ```

2. **Remove Cleartext Traffic**
   - Android: Remove `android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"`
   - iOS: Remove `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads`

3. **Secure API Keys**
   - Move API keys to environment variables
   - Implement secure key management
   - Rotate exposed keys

### Short-term Actions (Medium Priority)

1. **Permission Review**
   - Audit each permission request
   - Implement runtime permission handling
   - Remove unnecessary permissions

2. **URL Validation**
   - Implement proper URL validation
   - Use HTTPS for all connections
   - Sanitize user inputs

3. **Code Obfuscation**
   - Customize ProGuard rules
   - Implement proper code signing
   - Enable R8 optimization

### Long-term Actions (Low Priority)

1. **Security Testing**
   - Implement automated security scanning
   - Regular penetration testing
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning

2. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Implement crash reporting
   - Add security event logging
   - Monitor for suspicious activities
