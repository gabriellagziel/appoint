# 🚀 Share-in-Groups Feature Deployment

## Overview

This PR deploys the **Share-in-Groups** feature, enabling users to share meetings into groups (WhatsApp, Messenger, etc.) with secure invite links, guest RSVPs, group membership tracking, and public meeting pages.

## 🎯 Feature Summary

- **Meeting ↔ Group Association**: Link meetings to groups with visibility controls
- **Share Links**: Secure, rate-limited share links with expiry and revocation
- **Guest Tokens**: HMAC-based secure tokens for temporary access
- **Public Meeting Pages**: Guest and member flows with RSVP functionality
- **Analytics**: Comprehensive event tracking and conversion funnel analysis
- **Security**: Firestore rules, rate limiting, and access control

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria Checklist

### ✅ **Code Quality & Testing**

- [ ] Public page p95 response time < 600ms
- [ ] Database queries optimized with proper indexing
- [ ] Rate limit cleanup jobs configured

### ✅ **Analytics & Monitoring**

- [ ] Telemetry verification script exits 0 (`tools/telemetry_verify.ts`)
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured (reads spike, rules denials)
- [ ] Conversion funnel tracking implemented
- [ ] Error rate monitoring active

### ✅ **Feature Flags & Rollout**

- [ ] Cloud Functions deployed with proper configuration
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline passes all checks
- [ ] Deployment scripts tested and documented

### ✅ **Documentation & Runbooks**
- [ ] API documentation updated
- [ ] User guides created

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Components
- **Models**: `Meeting` with `groupId` and `MeetingVisibility`
- **Services**: `ShareLinkService`, `GuestTokenService`, `RateLimitService`
- **Analytics**: `MeetingShareAnalyticsService` with comprehensive tracking
- **Security**: Firestore rules for all collections with proper access control

### Database Schema
```javascript
// share_links collection
{
  shareId: string,
  meetingId: string,
  groupId?: string,
  createdBy: string,
  createdAt: timestamp,
  expiresAt?: timestamp,
  usageCount: number,
  maxUsage?: number,
  revoked: boolean
}

// guest_tokens collection
{
  token: string,
  claims: object,
  createdAt: timestamp,
  expiresAt: timestamp,
  isActive: boolean
}

// rate_limits collection
{
  actionKey: string,
  subjectId: string,
  timestamp: timestamp,
  hits: number
}
```

### Security Rules
- Share links: Admin read, authenticated create, owner update/revoke
- Guest tokens: Admin read, authenticated create, owner revoke
- Rate limits: Admin read/write only
- Meetings: Group members read, owner write, public if configured

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Conversion Funnel Targets
- **CTR**: `share_link_created → share_link_clicked` ≥ 10%
- **Join Rate**: `clicked → group_member_joined_from_share` ≥ 20%
- **RSVP Rate**: `clicked → rsvp_submitted_from_share` ≥ 10%

### Performance Targets
- **Response Time**: Public page p95 < 600ms
- **Error Rate**: < 1% of requests
- **Rate Limit Hits**: < 50/hour per action
- **Invalid Tokens**: < 5% of attempts

### Security Targets
- **Permission Denied**: < 1% of requests
- **No Data Leakage**: Zero unauthorized access
- **Token Validation**: 100% of tokens properly validated

## 🚨 Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. **Immediate**: Disable feature flags via Firebase Remote Config
2. **5 minutes**: Run `./scripts/rollback_share_groups.sh`
3. **10 minutes**: Revoke all active share links and guest tokens
