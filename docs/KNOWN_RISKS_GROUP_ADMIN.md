- Automated testing
- Manual testing procedures
- Test-driven development

**Detection**:
- Coverage metrics
- Bug tracking
- Regression testing

## Security Risks

### 12. Client-Side Permission Bypass
**Risk**: Users manipulating client-side code to bypass permissions.

**Impact**:
- Unauthorized access
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data breaches

**Mitigation**:
- Server-side permission validation
- API security measures
- Client-side obfuscation
- Regular security audits

**Detection**:
- Security monitoring
- Unusual activity alerts
- Penetration testing

### 13. Data Exposure
