# AI Agent Rules & Instructions

**READ THIS FIRST:** These are persistent rules for AI agents working with this user. Always reference this file when starting a new conversation.

## General Behavior Rules

### Communication Style
- **Response Length**: [Choose: Brief and concise / Detailed explanations / Balanced]
- **Technical Level**: [Choose: Beginner-friendly / Intermediate / Advanced technical depth]
- **Confirmation**: [Choose: Always ask before major changes / Proceed with confidence / Ask only for destructive operations]

### Code & Development
- **Primary Languages**: [e.g., Dart/Flutter, Python, JavaScript]
- **Code Style**: [e.g., 2 spaces, camelCase for Dart, snake_case for Python]
- **Testing**: [e.g., Always include tests / Manual testing only / Test-driven development]
- **Documentation**: [e.g., Add comments for complex logic / Minimal comments / Full documentation]

### File Operations
- **Backups**: [e.g., Always backup before bulk changes / Ask before backup / No automatic backups]
- **File Creation**: [e.g., Only create files when necessary / Ask before creating new files / Create freely]
- **Directory Structure**: [e.g., Follow existing patterns / Ask about structure / Suggest improvements]

## Project-Specific Rules

### This Project (Translation Management)
- **ARB Files**: [e.g., Always validate JSON syntax / Backup before changes / Maintain key consistency]
- **Python Scripts**: [e.g., Follow existing logging patterns / Include progress indicators / Handle errors gracefully]
- **Translation Keys**: [e.g., Preserve context / Use consistent naming / Validate completeness]

## Workflow Preferences

### Planning & Execution
- **Show Plans**: [Choose: Always show plan before implementing / Jump straight to implementation / Ask if plan needed]
- **Error Handling**: [Choose: Robust error handling always / Basic error handling / Let me handle errors]
- **Validation**: [Choose: Validate all changes / Trust the implementation / Validate only critical changes]

### Tool Usage
- **Parallel Operations**: [Choose: Use parallel tools when possible / Sequential operations preferred / Ask before parallel execution]
- **Command Execution**: [Choose: Execute commands automatically / Always ask permission / Show commands first]

## Specific Do's and Don'ts

### ALWAYS Do:
- [Add your specific requirements, e.g.:]
- Check file syntax before saving
- Include error handling in scripts
- Validate JSON in ARB files
- [Add more as needed]

### NEVER Do:
- [Add your prohibitions, e.g.:]
- Delete translation files without backup
- Modify production configurations
- Make breaking changes without warning
- [Add more as needed]

### ASK FIRST Before:
- [Add operations that need approval, e.g.:]
- Bulk file operations
- Installing new dependencies
- Modifying core system files
- [Add more as needed]
