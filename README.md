## 🚀 Advanced Features

### Custom Workflows

Create additional workflows in `.github/workflows/`:

```yaml
name: Custom Workflow
on:
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Daily at 2 AM UTC

jobs:
  custom-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Custom Step
        run: echo "Hello from custom workflow!"
```
