### Permission Checks

- Server-side validation for all actions
- Clear feedback for insufficient permissions

## State Management

### Riverpod Providers
- `FutureProvider` for data fetching
- `AsyncNotifier` for actions
- Automatic invalidation and refresh
- Error handling and loading states

### Provider Structure
```
groupMembersProvider(groupId)
groupPolicyProvider(groupId)
groupVotesProvider(groupId)
groupAuditProvider(groupId)

groupAdminActionsProvider
groupPolicyActionsProvider
groupVoteActionsProvider
```

## Error Handling

### UI Error States
- Loading indicators
- Error messages with retry buttons
- Empty state messages
- SnackBar feedback for actions

### Error Types
- Network errors
- Permission errors
- Validation errors
- Server errors

## Responsive Design

### Mobile/Web Compatibility
- `LayoutBuilder` for responsive layouts
- `MediaQuery` for screen size adaptation
- Flexible widget sizing
- Touch-friendly interactions

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- Widget tests for all components
- Provider tests for state management
- Permission tests
- Error handling tests

### Test Files
- `group_policy_tab_test.dart`
- `group_votes_tab_test.dart`
- Additional tests for other components

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```dart
// Navigate to group details
context.go('/groups/$groupId');

// The screen automatically loads with tabs
```

### Customization
```dart
// Custom tab order
TabBar(
  tabs: [
    Tab(text: 'Members'),
    Tab(text: 'Admin'),
    Tab(text: 'Policy'),
    Tab(text: 'Votes'),
    Tab(text: 'Audit'),
  ],
)
```
