## What was implemented:

### ✅ Data Models
- `GroupRole` - enum with owner/admin/member + permission methods
- `GroupPolicy` - group settings and permissions
- `GroupVote` - voting system with ballots and results
- `GroupAuditEvent` - audit logging with event types

### ✅ Services (Partially Complete)
- `GroupAdminService` - role management (partially implemented)
- `GroupVoteService` - voting system (complete)
- `GroupAuditService` - audit logging (complete)
- `GroupPolicyService` - policy management (complete)

### ✅ Riverpod Providers
- Complete provider setup for all services
- Permission checking providers
- Combined UI providers

### 🔄 Still Needed:
- Complete GroupAdminService methods (demoteAdmin, transferOwnership, removeMember)
- UI Components (group_admin_panel.dart, etc.)
- Integration with GroupDetailsScreen
- Firestore Rules updates
- Tests

## Current Status:
- Core models: ✅ Complete
