# Phase 6: Group Admin Tools - COMPLETE ✅

## What was implemented:

### ✅ Data Models
- `GroupRole` - enum with owner/admin/member + permission methods
- `GroupPolicy` - group settings and permissions
- `GroupVote` - voting system with ballots and results
- `GroupAuditEvent` - audit logging with event types

### ✅ Services (Complete)
- `GroupAdminService` - role management with all methods:
  - `promoteToAdmin()` ✅
  - `demoteAdmin()` ✅
  - `transferOwnership()` ✅
  - `removeMember()` ✅
- `GroupVoteService` - voting system (complete)
- `GroupAuditService` - audit logging (complete)
- `GroupPolicyService` - policy management (complete)

### ✅ Firestore Rules
- Complete security rules for:
  - `/user_groups/{groupId}` - read/write permissions
  - `/user_groups/{groupId}/votes/{voteId}` - voting permissions
  - `/user_groups/{groupId}/audit/{eventId}` - audit permissions
  - Role-based access control
  - Vote validation (one vote per user)

### ✅ Riverpod Providers
- Complete provider setup for all services
- Permission checking providers
- Admin action providers
- Combined UI providers

### 🔄 Still Needed:
- UI Components (group_admin_panel.dart, etc.)
- Integration with GroupDetailsScreen
- Tests (basic structure created)

## Key Features:

### 🔐 Permission System
- **Owner**: Full control (transfer ownership, remove anyone)
- **Admin**: Manage roles, remove members (not other admins)
- **Member**: Basic access, can vote

### 🗳️ Voting System
- Configurable via `GroupPolicy.requireVoteForAdmin`
- 48-hour default voting period
- Simple majority wins
- Automatic execution of passed votes

### 📊 Audit Logging
- All admin actions logged
- Event types: role_changed, member_removed, vote_opened, etc.
- Metadata tracking for detailed history

### 🛡️ Security
- Firestore rules enforce permissions
- Transaction-based role changes
- Protection against leaving group without owner

## Firestore Collections:
- `/user_groups/{groupId}` - Enhanced with roles and policy
- `/user_groups/{groupId}/votes/{voteId}` - Voting system
- `/user_groups/{groupId}/audit/{eventId}` - Audit log

## Status: READY FOR UI INTEGRATION 🚀
