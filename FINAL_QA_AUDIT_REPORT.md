## ⚠️ **REMAINING CRITICAL ISSUES**

### 🔴 **Structural Syntax Errors (~5,000 remaining)**
**Impact**: BLOCKS COMPILATION  
**Files Affected**: 6 key feature files
- `lib/features/onboarding/onboarding_screen.dart`: orphaned `finally` blocks
- `lib/features/ambassador_dashboard_screen.dart`: missing opening braces
- `lib/features/family/screens/family_dashboard_screen.dart`: mismatched braces
- `lib/features/family/widgets/invitation_modal.dart`: structural issues

**Solution Required**: Manual structural fixes for these 6 files

### 🟡 **Missing Generated Files**
**Impact**: BLOCKS FEATURES  
- Missing `lib/generated/l10n/` localization files
- Missing `*.freezed.dart` and `*.g.dart` files for models

**Solution Required**: Run `flutter packages pub run build_runner build` after structural fixes
