## 🏁 Conclusion

**Priority**: Implement logo upload UI and integrate business branding into client booking flows

**Timeline**: Core branding features can be implemented in **2-4 weeks** with focused development

The infrastructure is largely in place - it just needs UI completion and client-facing integration to provide a complete branded business experience.
