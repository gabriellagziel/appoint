# PR #64 Summary: codex/create-files-for-codex-and-setup

This document summarizes the changes and instructions introduced in pull request 64, merged as commit `dccf758`.

## Files Created / Modified
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` – updated container image and enabled Firebase CLI feature.
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` – new guidelines for pull request reviews.
- `AGENTS.md` – added project instructions for build, testing and CI.
- `test/fake_firebase_firestore.dart` – expanded fake Firestore implementation.

## Testing
Attempted to run `dart test --coverage` but it failed:
```
The current Flutter SDK version is 0.0.0-unknown.

Because appoint depends on share_plus >=0.6.5 which requires Flutter SDK version >=1.12.13+hotfix.5, version solving failed.
```
This indicates the Flutter SDK in the environment is misconfigured, preventing test execution and dependency resolution.

## Remaining Issues
- Flutter SDK must be installed or configured so that `flutter pub get` and tests can run.
- Packages listed in `pubspec.yaml` such as `share_plus` rely on a proper Flutter setup.
- `test/fake_firebase_firestore.dart` still lacks many method stubs beyond basic add/get operations.

## New Guidelines from AGENTS.md
```
flutter pub get
flutter run                # Android
dart run                  # CLI
flutter run -d chrome      # Web

# Start Firebase emulators for Auth & Firestore
firebase emulators:start --only auth,firestore

dart test --coverage
```
Developers should also ensure `test/test_setup.dart` initializes Firebase mocks as shown in AGENTS.md.
