## 📝 Notes & Considerations

1. **Firebase Dependency:** Current architecture is heavily Firebase-dependent. Migration to multi-cloud requires significant refactoring.

2. **Service Communication:** Need to define clear APIs between services, especially between mobile app and backend services.

3. **Data Consistency:** Consider implementing event sourcing or saga patterns for distributed transactions.

4. **Performance:** Monitor latency impact of service decomposition and implement caching strategies.

5. **Team Readiness:** Ensure team has necessary skills for microservices operations and troubleshooting.
