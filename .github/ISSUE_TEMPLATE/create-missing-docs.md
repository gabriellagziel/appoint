## Description
We currently only have high-level README, architecture, and routing docs. We need dedicated files for API reference, developer onboarding, and security guidelines.

## Current Issues
- Limited documentation coverage
- No API reference documentation
- Missing developer onboarding guide
- No security guidelines
- Difficult for new developers to get started

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] New files under `docs/`: `API.md`, `ONBOARDING.md`, `SECURITY.md`
- [ ] Each file contains a clear table of contents
- [ ] Basic placeholders for major sections (e.g. "Firebase Auth", "Collections", "Rate Limiting")
- [ ] Documentation build (if any) runs without errors
- [ ] Links to new docs added to main README

## Files to Create
- [ ] `docs/API.md` - API reference documentation
- [ ] `docs/ONBOARDING.md` - Developer onboarding guide
- [ ] `docs/SECURITY.md` - Security guidelines
- [ ] Update `docs/README.md` to include new docs

## Content Structure

### API.md
- Firebase Auth API
- Firestore Collections
- Cloud Functions
- External APIs (Stripe, etc.)

### ONBOARDING.md
- Development Environment Setup
- Flutter/Dart Installation
- Firebase Configuration
- Running the App
- Contributing Guidelines

### SECURITY.md
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Rate Limiting
- Data Protection
- Security Best Practices

## Implementation Steps
1. Create the three new documentation files
2. Add basic structure and placeholders
3. Update main README to link to new docs
4. Test any documentation build process
5. Review and refine content

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All three documentation files are created
- [ ] Each file has proper structure and placeholders
- [ ] Main README links to new documentation
- [ ] Documentation build process works (if applicable)
- [ ] Content is reviewed and approved
