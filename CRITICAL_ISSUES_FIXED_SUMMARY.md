# 🔧 **Critical Issues Fixed Summary**

## ✅ **MAJOR DEPENDENCY CONFLICTS RESOLVED**

### **1. Flutter & Dart SDK Upgrade** 🚀
- **Before**: Flutter 3.24.5 with Dart 3.5.4 (causing dependency conflicts)
- **After**: Flutter 3.32.6 with Dart 3.8.1 (latest stable)
- **Impact**: Resolved all major dependency version conflicts

### **2. Package Dependencies Fixed** 📦
```bash
✅ fl_chart: ^1.0.0 (now compatible)
✅ google_maps_flutter: ^2.12.3 (now compatible)
✅ googleapis: ^14.0.0 (now compatible) 
✅ googleapis_auth: ^2.0.0 (now compatible)
✅ geolocator: ^14.0.1 (now compatible)
✅ google_mobile_ads: ^6.0.0 (now compatible)
✅ vm_service: ^15.0.0 (now compatible)
```

## ✅ **CRITICAL LOCALIZATION KEYWORD CONFLICT FIXED**

### **3. Dart Keyword Conflict Resolution** 🔤
- **Issue**: `continue` is a reserved Dart keyword but was used as localization key
- **Error**: Generated 55+ localization files with syntax errors
- **Fix**: Renamed localization key from `continue` to `continueText`
- **Result**: All localization files now generate without syntax errors

**Before:**
```dart
String get continue => 'Continue'; // ❌ Syntax Error
```

**After:**
```dart
String get continueText => 'Continue'; // ✅ Valid
```

## ✅ **BUILD SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY RESTORED**

### **4. Project Build Status** 🔨
- **Before**: ❌ Project couldn't build due to dependency conflicts
- **After**: ✅ `flutter pub get` completes successfully
- **Test Status**: ✅ Smoke test passes
- **Dependencies**: ✅ All packages resolved
