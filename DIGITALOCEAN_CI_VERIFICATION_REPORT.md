## 📋 STEP 6 – RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Production Use
1. **Fix Dependencies**: Resolve missing Firebase/Riverpod packages
2. **Update Analysis**: Fix `very_good_analysis` package issues
3. **Test Execution**: Ensure all tests can run successfully
4. **Build Verification**: Test `flutter build web` functionality

### For CI/CD Integration
1. **Use Container**: `registry.digitalocean.com/appoint/flutter-ci:latest`
2. **Mount Volume**: `/workspace:/app` for project access
3. **Run Commands**: All Flutter commands available
4. **Handle Errors**: Expect dependency issues until resolved

## 🎯 STEP 7 – FINAL ASSESSMENT

### Environment Status: **READY FOR BASIC CI/CD** ✅

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Docker container successfully built and functional
- ✅ Flutter 3.32.5 properly installed and working
