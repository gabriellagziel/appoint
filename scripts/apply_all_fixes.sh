git commit -m "🔧 CRITICAL FIXES: Resolve 35+ build-blocking issues

📊 FIXES APPLIED:
- DateTime imports: 10 files (dart:core imports)
- JSON serialization: Remove incorrect @JsonSerializable() from DateTimeConverter  
- State variables: Enhanced onboarding + personal scheduler
- Provider definitions: messagingServiceProvider + fcmTokenProvider
- Localization: 15 missing ARB keys (sendNow, dashboard, etc.)
- Type safety: Dynamic casting in app_router + survey_provider
- Error handling: Fixed catch blocks in survey_provider

🎯 EXPECTED OUTCOME:
- Build runner should now work successfully
- Most compilation errors should be resolved
- Generated files (.g.dart, .freezed.dart) should create properly

⚠️ NEXT STEPS:
1. Run: flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
2. Test: flutter analyze  
3. Build: flutter build web --debug
