- [ ] **Service worker**: Confirm `flutter build web` outputs updated `flutter_service_worker.js`
- [ ] **Bump version**: Update service worker version so clients don't cache old JS
- [ ] **Env flags**: Set `USE_MOCK_AUTH=false` for staging if you used that locally

### Security Rules

## ðŸš¨ Monitoring & Rollback

### Rollback Procedures
```bash
# Re-deploy previous rules (if you keep versions)
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules --project $STAGING_PROJECT_ID --force

# Roll back hosting to last release
firebase hosting:channel:deploy live --project $STAGING_PROJECT_ID

# Emergency rollback (if needed)
firebase hosting:revert --project $STAGING_PROJECT_ID
```

### Health Checks
