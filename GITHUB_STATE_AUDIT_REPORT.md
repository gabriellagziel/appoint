- **Risk Level:** üü° HIGH

### 3. **Recent Merge Activity**
- **Last Merge:** PR #417 (cursor/REDACTED_TOKEN)
- **Status:** Successfully merged but may have introduced workflow conflicts
- **Risk Level:** üü° MEDIUM

## üìä REPOSITORY HEALTH ANALYSIS

### ‚úÖ HEALTHY COMPONENTS
- Main branch is clean and up-to-date
- No uncommitted changes
- Recent successful merges
- Flutter project structure is intact
- Dependencies are properly configured

### ‚ùå PROBLEMATIC COMPONENTS
- Excessive branch proliferation
- Multiple conflicting CI/CD workflows
- Potential merge conflict residues
- GitHub sync instability

## üéØ CLEANUP OBJECTIVES

### Objective 1: Pull Request Cleanup
- [ ] Identify all open PRs related to CI/CD, test, l10n, secrets, deploy
- [ ] Check mergeability status of each PR
- [ ] Close/delete broken/duplicate PRs
- [ ] Reopen clean PRs if needed

### Objective 2: Branch Health Check
- [ ] Validate main branch buildability
- [ ] Create safe-backup branch
- [ ] Revert broken changes if necessary

### Objective 3: GitHub Sync Fix
- [ ] Test Cursor push capability
- [ ] Check GitHub Actions status
- [ ] Re-authenticate if needed

### Objective 4: CI Workflow Sanity Check
- [ ] Disable broken workflows temporarily
- [ ] Remove corrupted/duplicate workflow files
- [ ] Keep only essential ci.yml
- [ ] Rebuild CI logic after GitHub is healthy

## üõ†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Emergency Stabilization (PRIORITY 1)
1. **Create Safe Backup**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b safe-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
   git push origin safe-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
   ```

2. **Disable Problematic Workflows**
   - Temporarily disable all non-essential workflows
   - Keep only basic CI workflow

3. **Branch Cleanup**
   - Delete stale codex/cursor branches
   - Keep only main and essential feature branches

### Phase 2: CI/CD Recovery (PRIORITY 2)
1. **Workflow Consolidation**
   - Merge duplicate CI workflows
   - Remove conflicting configurations
   - Establish single source of truth

2. **Secrets Validation**
   - Verify all required secrets are configured
   - Test deployment capabilities

### Phase 3: Production Readiness (PRIORITY 3)
1. **Test Main Branch**
   - Verify buildability
   - Run comprehensive tests
   - Validate deployment pipeline

2. **Documentation Update**
   - Update CI/CD documentation
   - Create branch management guidelines

## üìã EXECUTION CHECKLIST

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Repository state analysis
- [x] Branch inventory
- [x] Workflow file audit
- [x] Recent commit analysis

### üîÑ IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Safe backup creation
- [ ] Workflow cleanup
- [ ] Branch deletion

### ‚è≥ PENDING
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline testing
- [ ] GitHub sync verification
- [ ] Production deployment test

## üö® CRITICAL WARNINGS

1. **DO NOT MERGE** any new PRs until cleanup is complete
2. **DO NOT DELETE** main branch or essential files
3. **BACKUP FIRST** before any destructive operations
4. **TEST THOROUGHLY** before re-enabling workflows

## üìû NEXT STEPS

1. **Immediate:** Execute Phase 1 cleanup
2. **Short-term:** Complete Phase 2 recovery
3. **Long-term:** Implement Phase 3 production readiness
